Randy wants a fishbowl the size of SPARC.

This PCB is a drop in replacement for the PCB in the device.

Highlights
==========
* Arduino Happy
* 2 brushed motor controllers built in (like in the original circuit)
* 2.4GHZ radio (Phase 2)
* Accellerometer and Gyro built in the so the fish can go where it wants.
* LIPO - 2S right now,  will consider 1S later.


Phase 1
=======

* PCB drawn and sent to the FAB
* Initial Firmware will be made that implements simple autonomous movements
  * Bump into something, move in a different direction
  * Get bored and scoot at random times.
  * 

Phase 2
=======

* Bluetoth/BT Low Enegery on board for iPhone/iPad control
  *  Will support a serial stream command mode
